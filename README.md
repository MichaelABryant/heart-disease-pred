# Project 2: US Vehicle Accidents EDA (Python)

This repository is for the analysis and modeling done on the Kaggle: Heart Disease ICU dataset. Below you will find an overview of the data, code, and results. The goal of this project was to perform an exploratory data analysis, to prepare the data (i.e., clean and feature engineer), and to apply machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease.

### Code Used 

**Python Version:** 3.7.10 <br />
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, warnings<br />
**For Web Framework Requirements:**  ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  

## Heart Disease Dataset

The dataset was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). The dataset contains 14 variables and 303 patient records.

### Variables

## heart-disease.ipynb

This is the Jupyter Notebook which contains the exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and ML modeling which was performed on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci).

### Data Cleaning

I cleaned the data to make the dataset usable for future modeling. I made the following changes:

### Featured Engineering

I feature engineered using the dataset for future modeling. I made the following changes:
